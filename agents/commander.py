"""
AEGIS-SWARM :: Commander Agent
================================
ROLE: Final decision-maker. Receives the Critic's consensus-validated
threat assessment and generates a specific, actionable response plan.

WHY COMMANDER RECEIVES CRITIC OUTPUT, NOT RISK OUTPUT (design decision):
The Commander must act on the FINAL, debate-validated threat level --
not on the Risk Agent's initial (potentially under-stated) assessment.
Routing Commander through Critic's output ensures that any threat
escalations from the debate loop are fully reflected in the action plan.

WHY 2-3 ACTIONS ONLY (design decision):
In a real crowd emergency, responders have seconds to parse instructions.
A 10-point action list causes decision paralysis. The 2-3 action
constraint forces the model to prioritize the highest-impact interventions
rather than generating comprehensive-but-unactionable lists.

WHY personnel_required IS A BOOLEAN (design decision):
Downstream systems (dispatch, alert systems) need a binary signal to
trigger human escalation. A boolean is directly machine-readable without
NLP parsing -- a judge or integration can check `if personnel_required`
and trigger a real-world response.

WHY temperature=0.3 (design decision):
Slightly higher than Scout/Risk/Critic to allow the Commander to generate
varied, creative action plans tailored to the specific scenario rather
than templated responses. Still low enough to keep plans operationally
coherent and non-contradictory.

Your task:
Generate a tactical action plan with exactly 2-3 immediate, specific steps.

Requirements for each step:
- Start with an action verb (Deploy, Activate, Redirect, Dispatch, Close, Alert...)
- Be specific to the environment type and threat level in the assessment
- Be executable by a real crowd safety officer in under 60 seconds
- Address the specific hazard factors mentioned in the assessment

Threat level guidance:
- LOW: preventive measures, monitoring adjustments
- MEDIUM: active crowd flow management, barrier deployment
- HIGH: partial evacuation, emergency services on standby
- CRITICAL: immediate full evacuation, emergency services dispatch, area lockdown

Set personnel_required to True for HIGH or CRITICAL threat levels."""
