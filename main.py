"""
AEGIS-SWARM :: CLI Runner (Local Debug Mode)
=============================================
WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
server.py exposes the pipeline via HTTP for the Next.js frontend.
main.py is the local CLI entry point for rapid testing without
spinning up the full FastAPI server -- useful during development
and for Kaggle notebook demonstrations.

It mirrors the same pipeline logic as server.py (debate loop,
safe parsing, error handling) so results are consistent between
the API and CLI modes.

Usage:
    python main.py
    # Edit the `target_image` variable below to point at any test image.
